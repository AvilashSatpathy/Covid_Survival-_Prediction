Advancements in healthcare technologies have paved the way for developing predictive models that leverage machine learning algorithms to forecast the onset and progression of various diseases. This paper presents a comprehensive disease prediction system integrating multiple machine-learning techniques for enhanced accuracy and reliability. The system incorporates a diverse range of data sources, including patient demographics, clinical history, genetic information, and lifestyle factors, to provide a holistic approach to disease prediction.
Coronavirus (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.
During the entire course of the pandemic, one of the main problems that healthcare providers have faced is the shortage of medical resources and a proper plan to efficiently distribute them. In these tough times, being able to predict what kind of resource an individual might require at the time of being tested positive or even before that will be of immense help to the authorities as they would be able to procure and arrange for the resources necessary to save the life of that patient.
This report examines COVID-19 data provided by the Mexican government. The purpose is to predict from early data taken from patients at hospitals who are at high risk for dying from the infection as well as identify critical factors that contribute to increased risk of death. A Random Forest Classification model was built, and it was found that the two largest factors were the age of the patient and whether or not the patient had pneumonia. Other factors that contributed to some degrees were whether or not the patient had diabetes, hypertension, or chronic renal disease. The predictions were tuned to achieve 97% accuracy in predicting who is at high risk of dying from COVID-19 infection (sensitivity) and 3% error when deciding if someone was at low risk of dying from COVID-19 infection (false negative rate).
Thus, medical professionals are very interested in automating the diagnosis process by integrating machine learning techniques with physician expertise. Data mining and machine learning approaches are making significant efforts to intelligently translate accessible data into valuable information in order to improve the diagnostic process's efficiency. Several studies have been conducted to explore the use of machine learning in
terms of diagnostic abilities. It was discovered that, when compared to the most experienced physician, who can diagnose with 79.97% accuracy, machine learning algorithms could identify with 91.1% correctness. Machine learning techniques are explicitly used to illness datasets to extract features for optimal illness diagnosis, prediction, prevention, and therapy.
In conclusion, the proposed prediction system represents a significant advancement in the field of healthcare analytics. By integrating multiple machine learning algorithms, preprocessing techniques, and interpretable models, the system offers a comprehensive solution for accurate and transparent disease predictions.
